# Feature Development Workflow

**Type: Rigid** — Follow this process exactly. Do not skip steps.

Orchestrates the full feature development lifecycle by invoking other skills in sequence. Each step has a human gate before proceeding.

## Codebase Knowledge (read first)

Before Step 2 (Analysis), Step 3 (Design), Step 5 (Implementation Plan), and Step 6 (Build), read `docs/plans/CODEBASE-KNOWLEDGE.md` if it exists — the codebase map (entry points, state ownership, navigation, networking, UI/localization/analytics conventions, build/tooling diagnostics; task index at the top). Honor it during the relevant step (don't restate it in artifacts); consult it before exploring or when unsure how something is done here.

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting, verify that required skills are available:
- `fatsecret-workflow:story-analysis`
- `fatsecret-workflow:write-test-plan`
- `fatsecret-workflow:review-task`
- `fatsecret-workflow:writing-plans`
- `superpowers:verification-before-completion`
- `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`

If superpowers skills are missing, tell the user:
> "This workflow requires the superpowers plugin. Install it with: `claude plugins add superpowers-marketplace/superpowers`"

**Note on testing:** Tasks with testable logic are built with **TDD** — the engineer writes a failing unit test first, then implements until it passes, iterating with `xcodebuildmcp` (`build_sim` to compile, `test` to run). The unit-test scope for the feature is defined in the test plan's **Unit Test Coverage** section. Per-task verification — including re-running the task's unit tests — is owned by `review-task`. UI tests and snapshot tests are out of scope; the unit test target is `Calorie Counter Tests`.

## Workflow at a Glance

```
Step 1: Introduction        — collect input, confirm output folder
Step 2: Story Analysis      — understand stories + explore code [skip if no stories]
Step 3: Design Exploration  — architecture decisions, implementation approach
Step 4: Test Plan           — manual QA + unit-test coverage; mandatory Codex coverage challenge
Step 5: Implementation Plan — detailed task breakdown (plan defines each task's steps)
Step 6: Build               — execute each task per the plan; review-task is the verdict gate
Step 7: Verify & Ship       — final verification + finish branch
```

## Output Directory

All workflow artifacts for a feature are saved under a single folder:

```
docs/plans/<feature-name>/
  ├── story-analysis.html       (from Step 2)
  ├── design.html               (from Step 3)
  ├── test-plan.html            (from Step 4)
  └── implementation-plan.html  (from Step 5)
```

The feature folder name is confirmed with the user in Step 1.

### Document format — HTML with a sticky TOC

All plan artifacts (story-analysis, design, test-plan, implementation-plan) are written as **self-contained HTML** (inline CSS, no external deps) with a **left-side sticky Table of Contents**. These docs are reviewed in a browser by humans (dev / QA), not in a code editor — a sidebar TOC is far more navigable than scrolled markdown for documents this size.

Use the shared skeleton at `references/plan-doc-skeleton.html` (in this skill's directory) as the starting structure for every artifact — it carries the proven CSS and the helper classes (`.item-card`, `.task-card`, `.gate`, `.callout`, `.field-label`, `.tag`/`.items-tag`, `.meta`). The sub-skills (`story-analysis`, `write-test-plan`, `writing-plans`) describe the *content* of each doc; this skeleton supplies the *rendering*.

A project may override the format in its own CLAUDE.md (e.g. `docs/plans/<area>/CLAUDE.md` "Plan document format"). If a project explicitly asks for markdown or CSV, follow that instead.

---

## Large Projects — Phase Mode

Some efforts are too large to run as a single feature (a migration, a multi-subsystem rollout). Run them in **phase mode** instead of one giant feature-workflow pass:

1. **One project-level story-analysis, done ONCE.** Run `story-analysis` for the whole project up front, saved at the project root (`docs/plans/<project>/story-analysis.html`). It covers every phase's stories and the cross-cutting decisions — you do NOT redo it per phase.
2. **Each phase is its own feature-workflow run**, scoped to a phase subfolder:
   ```
   docs/plans/<project>/
     ├── story-analysis.html            (project-wide, done ONCE)
     ├── CLAUDE.md                      (project conventions: doc format, logging, …)
     └── phase-N-<name>/
         ├── design.html                (this phase — Step 3)
         ├── test-plan.html             (this phase — Step 4)
         └── implementation-plan.html   (this phase — Steps 5–6)
   ```
   For each phase, treat its subfolder as the feature folder and run **Steps 3–6 plus the per-phase verification (Step 7a + 7b)**; Step 7c (finish branch) is NOT per-phase — it follows point 4's timing. **Skip Step 2's story gathering** — the project-level analysis already covers it (only re-open it if a phase surfaces genuinely new stories). But Steps 3–5 STILL take the project-root `story-analysis.html` as their story-analysis input: treat it as the *"with story analysis"* path in Step 3, not *"explore from scratch."*
3. **Design decisions are numbered and shared across phases** (`D1`, `D6`, …) so later phases reference earlier ones. Record them in each phase's `design.html` and cross-link.
4. **Settle branch strategy + Step-7 timing with the human at project start.** Phases commonly accumulate on one long-lived branch with the final finish-branch (Step 7c) run once at project end rather than per phase — but confirm this rather than assuming it; don't run a per-phase merge/PR unless the human asked for one.

When the user names a phase ("Phase 5", "P5"), that phase's subfolder is the feature folder for its Step 3–6 artifacts — the project-level `story-analysis.html` + `CLAUDE.md` stay at the project root, not in the phase folder. The rest of each step applies unchanged.

## Step 1 — Introduction

### 1a. Collect input

Present this to the user and collect input:

> I'll guide you through our delivery workflow:
>
> **Analyze** → understand stories, explore code for hidden impacts
> **Design** → architecture decisions and implementation approach
> **Test Plan** → define acceptance criteria + unit-test coverage (Codex coverage challenge)
> **Plan** → detailed implementation steps per task
> **Build** → implement (TDD unit tests), build & run in simulator, review against Figma, commit
>
> To get started — do you have **Shortcut Stories** (Story IDs or Iteration ID) or **Figma designs** to share?

Collect Story IDs, Iteration IDs, and Figma URLs as provided.

### 1b. Scale check — offer phase mode

Before naming the output folder, judge the SIZE of what was collected. Offer **phase mode** (see "Large Projects — Phase Mode" above) ONLY when the work is a large epic / iteration that obviously spans multiple weeks and multiple releases — concretely, when **either** holds:

- the stories span **more than one iteration**, or
- there are **10+ stories**.

If neither holds, say nothing — proceed as a single feature run. Don't offer phase mode for a handful of stories in one iteration; it's overhead a small feature doesn't need.

When the threshold is met, use `AskUserQuestion` to offer the choice:
- **Single feature run** — one pass of Steps 2–7, all artifacts in one folder.
- **Phase mode** — one project-level story-analysis up front, then each phase run as its own pass (Steps 3–6 + 7a/7b).

If the user picks phase mode, record the decision + the phase breakdown in the project-root `CLAUDE.md` so every later phase run inherits it without re-asking. If the project is already set up in phases (a project-root `story-analysis.html` + `phase-*/` folders already exist), phase mode is already in effect — skip the question and proceed with the named phase.

### 1c. Confirm output folder

> "I'll save all artifacts to `docs/plans/<feature-name>/` — does this name work?"

(Phase mode: this phase's artifacts go in `docs/plans/<project>/phase-N-<name>/`; the project-level `story-analysis.html` + `CLAUDE.md` stay at the project root — confirm both.)

---

## Step 2 — Story Analysis [human gate]

**Skill**: `fatsecret-workflow:story-analysis`
**Condition**: Stories were provided (Story IDs, Iteration ID, or pasted text). If no stories, skip to Step 3.

Save output to `docs/plans/<feature-name>/story-analysis.html`.

---

## Step 3 — Design Exploration [human gate]

**Condition**: Always. Do NOT invoke any external skill for this step.

**Input varies by path:**
- **With story analysis** (Step 2 completed): Uses story-analysis output as input. Objectives: (1) Propose implementation approaches and architecture decisions for the Items (2) Identify existing code issues that affect this work (3) Design shared components and state management across Items
- **Without story analysis** (Step 2 skipped): Explore the idea from scratch — understand intent, propose approaches, present design.

Explore the codebase, discuss trade-offs, and present a design to the user. Wait for human confirmation.

Save output to `docs/plans/<feature-name>/design.html`.

---

## Step 4 — Test Plan [human gate]

**Skill**: `fatsecret-workflow:write-test-plan`
**Condition**: Always.

Uses the story-analysis output (if available) and design exploration output as input.

The test plan defines both the **manual QA acceptance cases** and a separate **Unit Test Coverage** section (the deterministic, non-UI units that get TDD unit tests in Step 6; target `Calorie Counter Tests`, no UI/snapshot tests). Before the plan is finalized, `write-test-plan` runs a **mandatory Codex devil's-advocate coverage challenge** over the whole draft (manual + unit) — this gate is not skippable.

Save output to `docs/plans/<feature-name>/test-plan.html`.

Wait for human confirmation before proceeding.

---

## Step 5 — Implementation Plan [human gate]

**Skill**: `fatsecret-workflow:writing-plans`
**Condition**: Always.

Uses all prior outputs (story-analysis, design, test plan) as input.

**Figma design coverage is enforced here.** Every UI element in the plan must have a corresponding Figma design node. If any UI element cannot be matched to a Figma node, ask the user for the design before including it in the plan. If you must make assumptions and build UI without a design, confirm with the human first. This is the checkpoint where missing designs surface — even if Figma URLs were not provided in Step 1, any UI work in the plan requires design backing.

Save output to `docs/plans/<feature-name>/implementation-plan.html`.

Wait for human confirmation before proceeding.

---

## Step 6 — Build

**Condition**: Always.

### Pre-task check

Before starting each new task, run `git status` to confirm the prior task committed cleanly. If uncommitted changes remain, investigate the root cause before starting the new task.

### Execution

Execute each task exactly as written in the plan. **The plan (defined by `fatsecret-workflow:writing-plans`) is the single source of truth for the steps inside a task.**

Invariants Step 6 enforces on top of the plan:

- `review-task` produces the `APPROVED` verdict that unlocks the task's final commit + `TaskUpdate(completed)` step.
- On `ESCALATED`, halt the task and surface the issues to the human.
- After `review-task` returns `APPROVED` and before the task's commit step, run the plan's "Capture codebase knowledge" step (`writing-plans` Step 2.5): review this task's code-review conversation, list the human's corrections, filter them through `docs/plans/CODEBASE-KNOWLEDGE.md`'s Trust Contract, and reconcile the latest context against existing entries — raising any line it contradicts (Trust Contract: "code wins — fix this file"). Only if something qualifies or a conflict was found, ask the human whether to add, correct, or remove entries (write only on an explicit yes). It never blocks the commit and skips silently when nothing qualifies. This is the write-side counterpart to "Codebase Knowledge (read first)".
- Commit + `TaskUpdate(completed)` happen exclusively in the task's final plan step.
- The review-fix loop (iterate on issues until APPROVED, capped at 3 rounds before ESCALATED) lives inside `review-task`.

---

## Step 7 — Verify & Ship

Three sub-steps to close out the feature:

### 7a. Test plan verification

**Condition**: Always (test plan is written in Step 4).

Verify coverage against implementation. Informational — does not block.

### 7b. Verify before completion

**Skill**: `superpowers:verification-before-completion`
**Condition**: Always.

Run the full unit-test suite (`xcodebuildmcp` `test`, target `Calorie Counter Tests`) as part of this verification — the per-task gates already ran each task's tests; this confirms the whole suite is green before shipping. If the target can't be built/run (e.g., a non-app worktree), surface that rather than silently skipping.

### 7c. Finish branch

**Skill**: `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`
**Condition**: Always.

---

## Important

- Do NOT skip steps. If a conditional step does not apply, move to the next.
- Every step with a human gate requires explicit user confirmation before proceeding.
- All artifacts save to the feature's output directory, not the skill's default location.
- **Commit policy — applies to EVERY commit/push in the workflow.** Never run `git commit` / `git push` without an explicit human OK given in the *same* turn. Authorization is **single-use and per-commit**: a "go" / "y" from an earlier turn never carries over to a later commit. `review-task`'s `APPROVED` **is** the same-turn OK for *that task's* Step 3 commit — but it authorizes only that one commit, never the next task, a push, or a housekeeping commit. Subagents NEVER commit; commits happen only in the main agent's plan Step 3 (after `review-task` returns `APPROVED`) or in Step 7, each with its own same-turn OK.
